# approx_circuits

Using C-Code to create Conventional Approximate circuits. \n
Though MATLAB is powerful but for large vector test cases it becomes very slow.
A/d to this [article](https://jonathankinlay.com/2018/10/comparison-programming-languages/) MATLAB is 11 times slower than C++
So using C++ we may have an edge over the timing issue.
